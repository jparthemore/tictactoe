create a 9 block grid
have all squares start out grey
2 players - first one starts out w/X, 2nd player is O
if active players is X and clicks on a square it turns one color and has X on it
if active players is Y and clicks on a square it turns a different color and has Y on it
check each time a user clicks on a square - if 3 of either X or Y in a row horizontally or vertically or diagonally then that row turns yet another color
there will be a clear button to reset the board

challenges - just getting a tictactoe board to display nicely and have the users alternately add X and O
real challenge - figuring out how to determine a winner
another challenge - getting a banner to display upon win - in the middle of the board, not the entire screen --and then having it fade out/disappear after a bit so as not to be too annoying (use of timer)
